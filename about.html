          <h1>Welcome to my official about me site, created by me! I made this site so that users like yourself might come on here looking for certain public info about me for whatever reason. Hope you like! :)<br><br>Here's all the main info you'll need if you want to learn just a little about me: <br> First of all, I'm a boy, and like all boys, I like to play video games. I play a variety of games from shooting games to just regular mobile or competitive games. My fav, however, over all of these is Minecraft.<br><br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmB9b5njVbA?si=0dJyiTVGkyZlhYP8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
            Aside from gaming, I do have other hobbies which I perform from time to time such as coding, listening to music, reading books, and hanging with friends. And, uh, yeah, that's about it. If you have any inquiries, feel free to <a href="mailto:samplemail@gmail.com">email</a> me and be sure to check out my socials! :)
